I am a software engineer working at Wallapop with a passion for cybersecurity.

This is my blog site, which I set up to document my journey learning cybersecurity. The site will also be holding some other tech stuff that I might be interested in and take up as a project.

I believe that documenting what I do or learn is much helpful to me to have a clear understanding of the topic in scope. Another main aim of mine is to post writeups on the various CTFs that I will be solving, the path Iâ€™m following to achieve some certifications, etc.
