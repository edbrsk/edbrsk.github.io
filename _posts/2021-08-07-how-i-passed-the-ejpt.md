title: How I passed the eJPT
---

Having recently completed the [eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/)
certification, I decided to write this post with some useful commands/techniques that could help some of you to prepare/pass the exam, but first, let's write down a little review of the certification.

## Course Review

Due to my background, I just took a quick look at the material, but I skipped a lot.
I saw too many presentations/powerpoints/slides/whatever, so I went quickly through all of them, and I jumped to the black box labs.

The material provided by [INE](https://my.ine.com/path/a223968e-3a74-45ed-884d-2d16760b8bbd) is superb (and free).
I skipped some parts, but this depends on your previous experience. If you are a junior, then I don't recommend following my path.

I went through all the 3 black box labs, and they are IMO harder than the exam (at least in my case).
The examâ€™s funny! There are 20 questions to answer, and 15 correct answers are required to pass.
I started the exam at 22:00, I read all the questions first, and then I started to answer the questions while I found the correct answers in the exam lab.
I finished at 02:00.

eJPT has been my first infosec certification, and it seemed to me "easy" (compared to HackTheBox boxes (easy/medium) level for example) but realistic scenario, so I enjoyed that!
I don't have any other certification to compare though, please don't get me wrong.

Do I recommend the certification? Yes, for sure! :) Buy your voucher and enjoy it!
