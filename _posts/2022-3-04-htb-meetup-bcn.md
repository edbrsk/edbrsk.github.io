## 1. Introduction

The goal of the meetups is to make Hack The Box more approachable to everyone. During our meetups, we'll do walkthroughs on retired machines, the OSCP way. Don't worry, we'll do our best to explain everything as good as we can so everybody can follow along.

📢 The goal of this dashboard is to have a clear, dynamic view on all the important information. Further below in this dashboard you'll also find the requirements for the next meetup. Please note that these can change from time to time, depending on what we're planning. Make sure to always verify **before** each meetup that everything is in place to get started.

## 2. Hosts

I'm Edgar Ordóñez Rodríguez, Software Engineer at [@Wallapop](https://es.wallapop.com/) in Barcelona. I've been a cybersecurity enthusiast for a few years now. However, it was not until the last year that I started studying to achieve some of the best-known cyber certs meanwhile having fun with CTFs. I would like to see you at our meetups, and hopefully, we can share our passion for this field with all of you in these meetups.

## 8. FAQ

- **How much experience is expected?**

  If you’re a bit comfortable using Linux, you’ll probably be fine. We can’t promise you will understand everything, every time, BUT we do promise that we will do our best every single time to give as much context and explanation as we can. Besides, that, we will also share a lot of resources that can help you strengthen your skills, so you follow along better during the next meetup.

- **What is the goal of these meetups?**

  The goal is to start up a community that comes together monthly to hack some boxes together. The boxes picked for the meetups are the ones chosen by the hacking community to be related to the OSCP or eCPPTv2 exam, and we will also approach these boxes according to the OSCP exam regulations. This way everyone can prepare together or just come to learn new stuff.

- **Language of the Meetup?**
  The Meetup will be in Catalan/Spanish/English it will depend on the preferences of the attendees.
